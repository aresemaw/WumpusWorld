# Wumpus World
## Java implementation of AI Wumpus World 

### The Wumpus world is based on video game, The world consists of a cave with 4 x 4 rooms connecting rooms. The objective is for the agent to pick up the gold to climb out without falling in a pit or being eaten by the Wumpus. The room with gold has glitter. The agent has one arrow which can eliminate the Wumpus, which will scream. The agent decides whether to move up , down , left, right or climb. The Wumpus is attempting to eat the agent but a stench can be smelt by the agent when the Wupus is in a room next to the agent . There is a pit in which the agent could potentially fall in if the agent chose the wrong square but a breeze can be felt when the agent is next to a pit. The agent uses its senses, smell, touch, sight  in order to win the game. 

### The wumpus world is a artifical intelligence example of logic based world. The Wumpus is a creature that will eat the agent in a grid. The agent is place is a grid and the main goal is to pick up the gold without falling into a pit, and getting ate. The agent can move up,shoot, pick up down, left and right. The agent has one arrow to shoot the Wumpus. 

### The implentation has a grid, where there are directions and labels once running the code. The directions are move up,shoot, pick up down, left and right where you can control the game. There are letter symbols representing the players and pieces on the board. 

### From the exploration of the game, we can see how the agent uses perceptions in order to decide what actions to take. The agent is exercising knowledge-based concepts, such as making inferences based on previous knowledge. This concept can be applied to real world examples because this is how a human rationalizes decisions. If a real human was playing in the world, instead of an agent then the process and process would be the identical. The Wumpus world demonstrated how an agent can properly deduce and think like a human being to win the game.
